If the text isn't English and you don't told people what 'character encoding' you use is, they can't read the text correctly.

Words and sentences are created from characters, and characters that are needed for a specific purpose are grouped into a **character set**.  In each character set, each character is associated with a number, called a **code point**?? todo: does each character has a unique code point? does each character only belongs to a set?
